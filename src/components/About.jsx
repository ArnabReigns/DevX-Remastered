        {/* <p>
          DevX 1.0 is a product of the studentsâ€™ enthusiasm and interest in the
          club. Although the earlier events were on a selective basis, the
          interest of students is too intense to contain them within the four
          walls of the seminar hall, instead we decided to keep Devx1.0 open air
          students and have events dispersed throughout the vast Techno India
          Group campus at Salt Lake. This time, we are going to organize an open
          for all event to connect and coordinate among all the peers interested
          in tech and give them guidance throughout.
